# CaseStudy2

This case study is for Employees data to identify the attrition factor for a company. 

Employee dataset has all the information regarding the employees like their jobrole, education field, monthly income, personal information and the contribution and compensation details. 

We created employee df in R and did all the analysis on it. 

Drop the the columns with no variability.

Identify the factors which has negative or positive correlation with attrition. 

Analysis Conclusions:
1. We must treat any employee with a Total Attrition Score over 5 as an extreme risk of leaving the company.

2. The most important factors that indicate employees to leave are Monthly Salary, Job Level and Total Years in the Workface. 

3. Employees who work Overtime and those who are our Sales Representatives appear to be the two variables where the correlation to attrition is greatest.

4. We need to improve our Employee Survey. No trends are identifiable based upon the responses.

5. Important to remember it is impossible to completely qualify and quantify a person. There will be margin for error.

6. What is clear is our older and experienced workers are very happy and the retention rate is very high.
	- Of the our employees with over 11 years experience and 36 years old, we lost only 39 of 432 which includes retirements.

7. Bottom Line: We must improve the happiness for the younger portion where we can whether that be salary or additional benefits that allows us to retain them.
